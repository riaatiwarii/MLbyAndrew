# 💻 My First Attempt at Learning Machine Learning

This repository was my very first attempt at learning machine learning.  
It's **unorganized**, a bit **chaotic**, and definitely **not structured** the way I wanted it to be — but I'm keeping it here as a reminder of where I started.

---

## 🌪️ What Went Wrong

- I jumped into coding without proper structure.
- Files were added randomly without planning.
- I didn't separate topics or organize notebooks.
- I made mistakes with Git/GitHub while uploading things.

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

- The importance of structuring folders from Day 1.
- How to properly push projects to GitHub.
- Why project documentation and planning matters.
- Progress is not always perfect — but it's still progress.

## 🧭 What's Next

I've started a **new, clean, and well-structured repo** for my learning journey.  
Check it out here 👉 [New ML Learning Journey Repository](#) *(Add link when ready)*

## 🎯 Why This Repo Still Exists

Because **growth isn't always aesthetic**.  
This is proof that I tried, failed a bit, learned a lot, and kept going.
